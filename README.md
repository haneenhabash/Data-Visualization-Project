## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the importance and value of data visualization in the data analysis process. It has two main parts:

1. **Exploratory Data Visualization:** Systematically explore a selected dataset using Python visualization libraries, starting from univariate to multivariate plots.
2. **Explanatory Data Visualization:** Present interesting properties, trends, and relationships discovered in the dataset through polished and informative visualizations.

**Timeline:** 2005-01-01 to 2023-12-31  
**Author:** Haneen Habash - Data Analyst

## Objectives
- Learn to supplement statistics with visualizations to understand data.
- Explore distributions of variables and relationships between features.
- Apply design principles for effective visual communication of insights.

---

## Libraries Used
- Python 3  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  


---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Univariate Exploration:** Histogram, Count Plot, etc.
- **Bivariate Exploration:** Scatterplots, Box Plots, Heatmaps.
- **Multivariate Exploration:** Facet Plots, Plot Matrix, Clustered Bar Charts.
- Observations, questions, and insights are documented using the **Question-Visualization-Observations** framework.

---

## Explanatory Data Analysis
- Polished visualizations used to tell a clear story.
- Findings and insights are presented logically.
- Design considerations applied for clear communication.
